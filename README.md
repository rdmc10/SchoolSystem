# School management system

School management system app written in C# and WPF.

There are four types of users:
1. Admin
2. Teacher
3. Classmaster
4. Student

The admin can create classrooms, students, teachers and create links between the entities. (For example : Classroom-Teacher, Teacher-Subject, Classroom-Subject links).
Teachers can add marks and absences for students.
Students can view their marks and absences, as well as their averages for each subject/semester.

This is a personal project that I wrote as an assignment (University).
